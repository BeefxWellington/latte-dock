    //       and parameters that are valid
    // @since: 0.9
    readonly property int version: 9

    // NAME: inEditMode
    //   USAGE: read-only
    //   EXPLANATION: Latte sets it to true when this applet is in a Latte containment and Latte
    //       is also in EditMode, that means when the user is altering applets and Latte latteView settings
    // @since: 0.9
    readonly property bool inEditMode: root.editMode

    // NAME: palette
    //   USAGE: read-only
    //   EXPLANATION: Latte updates it to its coloring palette in order for the applet
    //       to take responsibility of its coloring.
    //   USE CASE: when Latte is transparent and applets colors need to be adjusted in order
    //       to look consistent with the underlying desktop background

    readonly property QtObject palette: disableLatteSideColoring ? colorizerManager : null

    // NAME: applyPalette
    //   USAGE: read-only
    //   EXPLANATION: Latte updates it to TRUE when the applet must use the provided
    //       Latte "palette" and FALSE otherwise

    //       to look consistent with the underlying desktop background

    // TYPE: bool
    //   USAGE: writable through actions.setProperty
    //   EXPLANATION: when is TRUE, Latte is not painting/colorizing this applet
    //       in any case. In such case the applet can use 'palette'
    //       in order to access the color palette used at all cases from Latte
    //   USE CASE: when Latte is transparent and applets colors need to be adjusted in order
    //       to look consistent with the underlying desktop background OR the applet
    //       is not using monochromatic icons but rather colorful ones.
    // @since: 0.9


    // NAME: disableLatteIconOverlay
    // TYPE: bool
    //   USAGE: writable through actions.setProperty
    //   EXPLANATION: when is TRUE, Latte is not overlaying any icons above
    //       the applet or alters the applet visual in any sense.
    //       That means that the applet is responsible to provide a coherent
    //       parabolic effect experience.
    // @since: 0.9
